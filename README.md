# FantasyFlightSim
This is a game I have been working on in Unity Game engine. It's a simple flight simulation game.

Flight Controls:
speed increase = forward if speed > 0 = arrow up
speed decrease = backward if speed < 0 / stop if speed =0 = arrow down
break = stop = RightControl: This just decreases the speed by greater increaments then speed decrease
Hover = up and down = Q: up E: down
Pitch = up and down = W: up S: down
Roll = tilt = left: arrow left right: arrow right
Yaw = turn = left: A right: D
shoot = fire normal gun = Space
missle = fire missle = RightShift
Boost = move faster = R
headLight(s) = toggle light = C
